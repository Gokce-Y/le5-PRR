# Introduction
<<<<<<< HEAD

Let’s be honest—when it comes to investing, most of us have asked ourselves:
=======
There comes a moment in life when we realize the importance of building lasting wealth, not just for our own security, but to create something meaningful for future generations. One of the most common paths to achieving this goal is through investment. And for many, that means stepping into the world of the stock market. 
But then the question arises:
>>>>>>> fd88e29948bf8f55e7b636db07cf50af995901df

::: {style="background-color:#f9f9f9; border-left:4px solid #FF6F61; padding:12px; font-style:italic; font-size:1.1em;"}
Should I go all in on a single high-performing stock, or play it safe by spreading the risk?
:::

Or maybe that question hasn’t crossed your mind yet—because you’re just starting out.

We’re taking a deep dive into stock market data, focusing on three major tech giants: Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft.
We’ll uncover trends, visualize performance, and break down how to assess stock risk using historical data.

Here’s what we’re exploring:

- How has the stock price changed over time?
- How do we calculate volatility?
- What is the average daily return of the stock?
- What is the correlation between different stocks?
- How much value is at risk when investing in a stock?
- How can we build a diversified stock portfolio?

<<<<<<< HEAD
We will answer these questions using R Studio.
=======
That’s exactly where this beginner-friendly analysis comes in.  
Using three of the most well-known companies—**Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla**—we’ve created a simple roadmap for anyone who’s looking to take their first steps into the stock market or just wants to better understand how it works.

### Getting the Data from Yahoo Finance

First we have to get the data.
Yahoo Finance is a rich resource of financial market data and tools to find compelling investments.
To get the data we use In R, there is quantmod.
Quantmod does not require any credentials or authorization, so we are able to hop right into getting our data.

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{r include=FALSE}
symbols <- c("AAPL", "MSFT", "TSLA")
# From there, we can combine that information with the getSymbols function:
getSymbols(symbols, src = "yahoo", from = "2019-01-01", to = "2024-12-31")
```

Now that we have the data we can start.


```{r include=FALSE}
aapl_df <- data.frame(date = index(AAPL), coredata(AAPL)) |>
  select(date, AAPL.Adjusted)

tsla_df <- data.frame(date = index(TSLA), coredata(TSLA)) |>
  select(date, TSLA.Adjusted)

msft_df <- data.frame(date = index(MSFT), coredata(MSFT)) |>
  select(date, MSFT.Adjusted)

merged_df <- aapl_df |>
  full_join(tsla_df, by = "date") |>
  full_join(msft_df, by = "date")
=======
From there,to start, we calculate the daily return, which is just the change in price from one trading day to the next. It’s a simple but powerful way to track how a stock performs over time, spot volatility, and get a better sense of how efficient a portfolio really is.


```{r include=FALSE}
returns_aapl <- dailyReturn(Ad(AAPL))
returns_msft <- dailyReturn(Ad(MSFT))
returns_tsla <- dailyReturn(Ad(TSLA))
>>>>>>> fd88e29948bf8f55e7b636db07cf50af995901df

```

### How has the stock price changed over time?

```{r echo=FALSE}
create_stock_plot <- function(data, y_col, title_text) {
  plot_ly(
    data = data,
    x = ~date,
    y = as.formula(paste0("~", y_col)),
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'lines',
    name = title_text
  ) %>%
    layout(
      title = paste0(title_text, " – Adjusted Closing Price"),
      xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
      yaxis = list(title = "Adjusted Close Price (USD)"),
      showlegend = FALSE
    )
}

p1 <- create_stock_plot(aapl_df, "AAPL.Adjusted", "Apple Inc. (AAPL)")
p2 <- create_stock_plot(tsla_df, "TSLA.Adjusted", "Tesla Inc. (TSLA)")
p3 <- create_stock_plot(msft_df, "MSFT.Adjusted", "Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)")

# Which Stock Has the Highest Risk?

**"When you're just starting to invest, one of the first questions you're likely to ask is: 'How risky is this stock?' Because let’s face it—risk is just as much a part of the game as reward."**

## Understanding Volatility

Volatility is a frequently encountered concept in the world of finance and holds great importance for investors.\
**But what exactly is volatility?** Volatility refers to the degree of fluctuation in the price of a financial asset.\
In other words, it describes how quickly and significantly the price of an asset changes.

In order to analyze the risk of the stock we'll need to take a closer look at the daily changes of the stock, and not just its absolute value.
we calculate the daily return, which is just the change in price from one trading day to the next.
It’s a simple but powerful way to track how a stock performs over time, spot volatility, and get a better sense of how efficient a portfolio really is.

```{r include=FALSE}
returns_aapl <- dailyReturn(Ad(AAPL))
returns_msft <- dailyReturn(Ad(MSFT))
returns_tsla <- dailyReturn(Ad(TSLA))

returns_df <- merge(
  "AAPL" = returns_aapl,
  "MSFT" = returns_msft,
  "TSLA" = returns_tsla
)
```


The line chart allows us to examine the time series behavior of daily returns for the three selected assets.

```{r}
plot_daily_return <- function(return_xts, ticker, line_color = "blue") {
  plot_ly() %>%
    add_lines(
      x = ~index(return_xts),
      y = ~coredata(return_xts),
      name = ticker,
      line = list(color = line_color)
    ) %>%
    layout(
      xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
      yaxis = list(
        title = sprintf("Daily Return of %s", ticker),
        titlefont = list(size = 10)),
      legend = list(x = 0.1, y = 0.9)
    )
}

p1 <- plot_daily_return(returns_aapl, "AAPL", "green")
p2 <- plot_daily_return(returns_msft, "MSFT", "blue")
p3 <- plot_daily_return(returns_tsla, "TSLA", "red")

p1
p2
p3

```





At first glance, one thing stands out: Tesla (TSLA) is far more volatile than Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).
While AAPL and MSFT tend to show steady, predictable price movements, TSLA swings much more aggressively from day to day.
This kind of behavior points to Tesla being a more speculative and higher-risk stock.

But how can we move beyond visual impressions and quantify this difference in volatility?

There are several ways to measure volatility, but the most common method is the calculation of **standard deviation**.
Standard deviation indicates how much an asset’s return deviates from its average.
A high standard deviation signifies high volatility, while a low standard deviation indicates low volatility.

Markets tend to get turbulent during uncertain times — whether it’s due to political unrest, economic shifts, natural disasters, or unexpected company news.
In such periods, stock prices can swing sharply, creating both big risks and big opportunities or losses.

The period from 2019 to 2024 was anything but ordinary.
From the COVID-19 outbreak and the vaccine rollout, to the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, and the recent AI-driven stock surge, markets have been shaped by one major event after another.

### Visualization: Volatility Over Time

To keep our analysis clear and accessible, we decided to use a simpler method — grouping adjusted daily returns into half-year periods and calculating the standard deviation for each group.

::: {style="margin-top:20px;"}
:::

```{r echo=FALSE}
returns_combined <- merge(returns_aapl, returns_msft, returns_tsla)
colnames(returns_combined) <- c("AAPL", "MSFT", "TSLA")
returns_df <- data.frame(Date = index(returns_combined),
                         coredata(returns_combined))
returns_df <- returns_df %>%
  mutate(HalfYear = paste0(year(Date), " H", ifelse(month(Date) <= 6, 1, 2)))

grouped_data <- returns_df %>%
  group_by(HalfYear) %>%
  summarise(across(c(AAPL, MSFT, TSLA),
                   list(Mean = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
                        SD = ~sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE))))


```

```{r echo=FALSE}
grouped_data$HalfYear <- factor(grouped_data$HalfYear, levels = grouped_data$HalfYear)

event_labels <- data.frame(
  HalfYear = c("2020 H1", "2021 H1", "2022 H1", "2023 H1"),
  label = c("COVID", "Vaccine", "War", "AI")
)

event_lines <- lapply(event_labels$HalfYear, function(h) {
  list(
    type = "line",
    x0 = h,
    x1 = h,
    y0 = 0,
    y1 = 1,
    xref = "x",
    yref = "paper",
    line = list(color = "red", dash = "dash", width = 0.5)
  )
})
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

volatility_plot <- plot_ly(data = grouped_data) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~HalfYear, y = ~AAPL_SD, name = "AAPL", type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %>%
  add_trace(x = ~HalfYear, y = ~MSFT_SD, name = "MSFT", type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %>%
  add_trace(x = ~HalfYear, y = ~TSLA_SD, name = "TSLA", type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %>%
  add_annotations(
    data = event_labels,
    x = ~HalfYear,
    y = 0,
    text = ~label,
    showarrow = FALSE,
    yanchor = "bottom",
    font = list(color = "red", size = 10)
  ) %>%
  layout(
    title = "6-Month Volatility by Stock with Key Events",
    xaxis = list(title = "Period (Half-Year)", tickangle = -45),
    yaxis = list(title = "Volatility (Standard Deviation)"),
    legend = list(title = list(text = "Stock")),
    shapes = event_lines
  )


volatility_plot


```

The results we got from the graph are pretty clear — and honestly, just what we expected.
In the first half of 2020, when COVID-19 hit, volatility for Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla spiked sharply as uncertainty flooded the markets.
Then, in early 2021, as vaccines rolled out, things began to calm down — a sign that investor confidence was coming back.

In early 2022, the Russia–Ukraine war caused another jump in volatility.
But again, over time, markets adjusted, and the fluctuations began to settle.

Up until that point, all three stocks were moving in sync — reacting to major events in similar ways and then stabilizing.
But in 2023, things started to shift.
With the rise of AI hype, Tesla began to stand out.
While Apple and Microsoft stayed on a smoother, more stable path, Tesla’s volatility crept up again — likely driven by speculation or excitement specific to the tech sector.

Yes, Tesla’s ups and downs are bigger, but that’s also part of what makes it appealing.
Higher risk often comes with the chance for higher returns — and for many investors, that’s a risk worth taking.

In the following section, we’ll take a closer look at how each stock actually performed.

# Average daily return of the stock

### Arithmetic Mean Return and Geometric Mean Return

Before diving into the results, let’s clear something up.
When it comes to measuring returns, there are two common methods: the arithmetic mean return and the geometric mean return.
Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right one depends on what exactly you're trying to analyze.

The arithmetic mean is calculated by adding up all daily (or annual) returns over a period and dividing the total by the number of observations.
Because it's simple and easy to interpret, it's often used for short-term performance comparisons and quick return estimates.

In this analysis, we’ll use the arithmetic mean because our focus is on comparing the average performance of each stock over specific time intervals, rather than modeling long-term compounded growth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Visualization: Average Returns Over Time

In the previous section, we mentioned that risk can also lead to reward.
So after seeing Tesla’s extreme volatility, you might be thinking:
=======
If you’ve followed along so far great! Let’s keep going.

In the previous section, we mentioned that risk can also lead to reward. So after seeing Tesla’s extreme volatility and massive drawdowns, you might be thinking:
>>>>>>> fd88e29948bf8f55e7b636db07cf50af995901df

***"Well, with all that risk, I hope the returns are worth it!"***

Let’s find out by grouping adjusted daily returns into half-year periods — using the same method we applied for volatility.

::: {style="margin-top:20px;"}
:::

```{r echo=FALSE}

return_plot <- plot_ly(data = grouped_data) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~HalfYear, y = ~AAPL_Mean, name = "AAPL",
            type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers', line = list(color = 'blue')) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~HalfYear, y = ~MSFT_Mean, name = "MSFT",
            type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers', line = list(color = 'orange')) %>%
  add_trace(x = ~HalfYear, y = ~TSLA_Mean, name = "TSLA",
            type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers', line = list(color = 'green')) %>%

  add_annotations(
    data = event_labels,
    x = ~HalfYear,
    y = 0,
    text = ~label,
    showarrow = FALSE,
    yanchor = "bottom",
    font = list(color = "red", size = 12)
  ) %>%

  layout(
    title = "6-Month Average Returns by Stock with Key Events",
    xaxis = list(title = "Period (Half-Year)", tickangle = -45),
    yaxis = list(title = "Average Daily Return", tickformat = ".1%"),
    legend = list(title = list(text = "Stock")),
    shapes = event_lines,
    hovermode = "x unified"
  )

return_plot


```

While Apple and Microsoft kept things relatively stable and steady throughout the period, Tesla stood out by swinging between the highest highs and the lowest lows.
If you want to understand the relationship between risk and return, Tesla is the perfect example.

In the first half of 2020, as the pandemic shook the world, Tesla skyrocketed.
Both its volatility and returns peaked.
It was one of those moments where taking a risk really paid off.

But it didn’t always go that way.
In the first half of 2022, with war and economic uncertainty in the air, Tesla was once again highly volatile — but this time, returns went negative.
Same level of risk, very different outcome.

By 2023, Tesla was back on its feet.
As the broader market started to recover, Tesla’s returns picked up again.

What all of this shows is simple: Volatility doesn’t just point to potential gains — it also warns us about possible losses.

### How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

This chart compares the expected daily returns and risks (standard deviation) of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA).
The x-axis shows the expected daily return, while the y-axis shows the risk.
This allows us to easily see each stock’s risk-return profile.

```{r}
returns_clean <- na.omit(returns_combined)
returns_df <- data.frame(Date = index(returns_clean), coredata(returns_clean))

mean_vals <- colMeans(returns_df[, c("AAPL", "MSFT", "TSLA")])
sd_vals <- apply(returns_df[, c("AAPL", "MSFT", "TSLA")], 2, sd)

summary_stats <- data.frame(
  Ticker = names(mean_vals),
  Mean = as.numeric(mean_vals),
  SD = as.numeric(sd_vals)
)

ggplot(summary_stats, aes(x = Mean, y = SD, label = Ticker, color = Ticker)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_text(nudge_y = 0.001, size = 5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Expected Daily Return vs Risk (Standard Deviation)",
    x = "Expected Daily Return",
    y = "Risk (Standard Deviation)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

As seen in the chart, Tesla offers the highest expected return but also comes with the highest risk.
Microsoft has the lowest risk with a moderate return, and Apple falls in between.
This helps investors balance risk and return when making decisions.

<p style="margin: 20px 0;">

Alright — now that things are starting to make a bit more sense, let’s go back to the question we asked at the very beginning:

:::

::: {style="margin-top:20px;"}
:::

Let’s take a closer look.

# Does diversification reduce risk?

There is a well-known saying often attributed to economist Harry Markowitz, the father of Modern Portfolio Theory:

::::: {style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 20px; margin: 30px auto; max-width: 900px;"}

```         
“Diversification is the only free lunch in investing.”
```

<img src="images/eggs.png" alt="Basket of Eggs" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;"/>
:::

<p style="margin-top:20px;">

Diversification means spreading investments across different assets to reduce exposure to the risk of any single investment.
The basic idea is that not all assets move in the same direction at the same time.
By combining assets with different risk and return profiles, investors can potentially reduce the overall risk of their portfolio while maintaining reasonable return expectations.
The goal of diversification is to reduce overall volatility and achieve a more balanced return by combining assets with low correlation.

</p>

### Correlation analysis

Correlation analysis is conducted to identify which assets, when combined in a portfolio, will have a risk-reducing effect.

::: {style="background-color:#fefefe; border-left:4px solid #64b5f6; padding:16px 20px; font-size:1.05em; color:#333; max-width:600px; margin: 30px auto; border-radius:6px; box-shadow:1px 1px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.04); line-height:1.6;"}
<p style="margin: 0;">

<strong>Low correlation</strong> reduces portfolio volatility.

</p>

<p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0;">

<strong>High correlation</strong> increases portfolio volatility.

</p>
:::

```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}


cor_matrix <- cor(returns_combined[, c("AAPL", "MSFT", "TSLA")], use = "complete.obs")

corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", 
         tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, addCoef.col = "black")

```

Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) show a strong positive correlation (0.73), indicating their daily returns tend to move in the same direction.
Tesla (TSLA) is less correlated with both AAPL (0.47) and MSFT (0.43), suggesting it behaves more independently in terms of daily returns.

#### Proposed Portfolio

The proposed portfolio allocation of 50% Microsoft, 30% Tesla, and 20% Apple is based on the observed correlation structure among the assets and the goal of achieving effective diversification.

Microsoft and Apple are highly correlated, which means they tend to move in the same direction.
Allocating too much to both would reduce diversification benefits.
Therefore, Microsoft is kept as the core low-volatility asset, while Apple’s weight is limited to avoid excessive overlap.

Tesla, on the other hand, has only moderate correlation with both Microsoft and Apple.
Including Tesla at a moderate level (30%) enhances diversification and adds growth potential, without excessively increasing portfolio risk.

### Method of Comparison

#### Shape Ratio :

The Sharpe ratio is one of the most widely used methods for measuring risk-adjusted relative returns.
It compares a fund's historical or projected returns relative to an investment benchmark with the historical or expected variability of such returns.

The higher the ratio, the higher the risk compensation an investment offers.
Investors will therefore have a preference for investments with a high Sharpe ratio or investments that raise the entire portfolio's Sharpe ratio through diversification.

<img src="images/shaperatio.png" alt="Sharpe Ratio Formula" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;"/>
:::

### Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that the proposed portfolio (50% Microsoft, 30% Tesla, 20% Apple) offers a higher risk-adjusted return than both an equally weighted portfolio and any single-asset portfolio.

To test this, we will compare the Sharpe ratio of the proposed allocation against:

a random portfolio with equal weights across all three assets, and

fully concentrated portfolios consisting of only Microsoft, only Apple, or only Tesla.

These comparisons are made without relying on correlation structures, allowing us to assess whether the proposed weights themselves lead to a more efficient risk-return outcome.

```{r include=FALSE}
returns <- na.omit(merge(
  dailyReturn(Ad(AAPL)),
  dailyReturn(Ad(MSFT)),
  dailyReturn(Ad(TSLA))
))

portfolio_sharpe <- function(weights, returns, name) {
  mean_ret <- colMeans(returns) * 252
  cov_matrix <- cov(returns) * 252
  port_return <- sum(weights * mean_ret)
  port_variance <- t(weights) %*% cov_matrix %*% weights
  port_volatility <- sqrt(port_variance)
  port_sharpe <- port_return / port_volatility
  
  cat("\n====", name, "====\n")
  cat("Sharpe Ratio: ", round(port_sharpe, 2), "\n")
}


portfolio_sharpe(c(0.50, 0.30, 0.20), returns, "Proposed Portfolio")       
portfolio_sharpe(c(0.33, 0.33, 0.33), returns, "Random Portfolio")         
portfolio_sharpe(c(0.00, 0.00, 1.00), returns, "100% Tesla")              
portfolio_sharpe(c(0.00, 1.00, 0.00), returns, "100% Apple")               
portfolio_sharpe(c(1.00, 0.00, 0.00), returns, "100% Microsoft")           


```

+---------------------------+--------------+
| Portfolio                 | Sharpe Ratio |
+===========================+==============+
| Proposed Portfolio        | 1.32         |
+---------------------------+--------------+
| Evenly Split Portfolio\   | 1.30         |
| (Equal weights: 33% each) |              |
+---------------------------+--------------+
| 100% Tesla                | 0.97         |
+---------------------------+--------------+
| 100% Apple                | 1.10         |
+---------------------------+--------------+
| 100% Microsoft            | 1.16         |
+---------------------------+--------------+

### Which Portfolio Performs Best?

As expected, the proposed portfolio (50% MSFT – 30% TSLA – 20% AAPL) achieved the highest Sharpe ratio (1.32) among all compared strategies, confirming our hypothesis that this allocation provides the most efficient return relative to the risk taken.

The Evenly Split Portfolio, which distributes capital equally across all three assets without considering their risk characteristics, follows closely with a Sharpe ratio of 1.30, but falls slightly behind in efficiency.

All single-asset portfolios (100% in either Tesla, Apple, or Microsoft) perform worse in terms of risk-adjusted return:

Tesla shows the lowest Sharpe ratio (0.97) due to its high volatility and drawdown,

Apple (1.10) and Microsoft (1.16) perform better individually but lack the benefits of diversification.

These results confirm that strategic asset allocation, rather than equal weighting or concentration in a single asset, leads to better risk-adjusted performance.

### Recommendation

While the proposed portfolio (50% Microsoft, 30% Tesla, 20% Apple) achieved the highest Sharpe ratio in our analysis, it is important to emphasize that there is no universally ideal portfolio.
The optimal allocation depends not only on numerical performance metrics but also on the investor's individual risk tolerance, goals, and personal preferences.

For example, an investor with a high risk appetite may reasonably prefer a higher allocation to Tesla, accepting greater volatility in exchange for potentially higher returns.
In contrast, a more conservative investor might prioritize stability and allocate more heavily to Microsoft or Apple.

Therefore, we recommend that portfolio construction should not be based solely on statistical indicators such as the Sharpe ratio.
Instead, investors should take into account their own investment personality, time horizon, and financial goals.
Quantitative results can inform decision-making—but they should be used as a guide, not as a rule.
