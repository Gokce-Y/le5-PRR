<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Let’s be honest—when it comes to investing, most of us have asked ourselves:</p>
<div class="callout-question">
<p><strong>Should I go all in on a single high-performing stock, or play it safe by spreading the risk?</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Or maybe that question hasn’t crossed your mind yet—because you’re just starting out.</p>
<p>In this article, we will answer key finance-related questions using data from Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Microsoft (MSFT).</p>
<p><img src="images/tma.webp" class="img-fluid"></p>
<section id="summary-of-questions-and-analysis-methods" class="level2" data-number="1.1">
<h2 data-number="1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-of-questions-and-analysis-methods"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Summary of Questions and Analysis Methods</h2>
<p>We’ll uncover trends, visualize performance, and break down how to assess stock risk using historical data.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re exploring and how we approached solving each question:</p>
<ul style="line-height:1.8; font-size:1.05em;">
<li>
<strong>How has the stock price changed over time?</strong><br> Analyzed using a line chart with Plotly (adjusted closing prices).
</li>
<li>
<strong>How do we calculate volatility?</strong><br> Calculated as the standard deviation of daily returns.
</li>
<li>
<strong>What is the average daily return of the stock?</strong><br> Computed using the arithmetic mean of daily returns.
</li>
<li>
<strong>How do you calculate the expected annual return for an asset?</strong><br> Estimated using the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) via linear regression on excess returns.
</li>
<li>
<strong>What is the correlation between different stocks?</strong><br> Assessed using a Pearson correlation matrix with visualization via <code>corrplot</code>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>How much value is at risk when investing in a stock?</strong><br> Visualized using a scatter plot of mean return versus standard deviation (risk-return profile).
</li>
<li>
<strong>How can we build a diversified stock portfolio?</strong><br> Based on diversification logic derived from correlation differences between assets.
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We answer all of these questions using RStudio and real financial data.</strong></p>

<p>First we have to get the data. Yahoo Finance is a rich resource of financial market data and tools to find compelling investments.</p>
<p>In R, we use the <strong><code>quantmod</code></strong> package to access Yahoo Finance data. It does not require any credentials or authorization, so we can hop right into getting our data.</p>

<p>In the code below, we calculate the excess return by subtracting the daily risk-free rate from the asset’s return.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-has-the-stock-price-changed-over-time"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> How has the stock price changed over time?</h2>
<p>One of the first questions in the mind of any new investor in the stock market is that why do stock prices change every second?</p>
<p>Well, there’s no straightforward answer to that question. The price of a stock is influenced by many different forces—each affecting its direction and magnitude. While it’s possible to understand some of these factors, trying to predict the market often proves to be more misleading than helpful.</p>
<p>Instead of predicting, a more effective approach is to observe how prices have moved in the past.</p>
<p>There are many ways to visualize change over time, but the most common is a line chart.</p>
<div style="background-color:#f1fdf5; border-left:4px solid #81c784; padding:10px 16px; margin: 20px 0; font-size:0.95em; color:#2e7d32;">
<p>In the code below, we create a chart using the Plotly library, which is great for this purpose because it allows you to zoom in, hover over points, and explore the data interactively.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the y-axis, you’ll notice that Tesla’s adjusted closing price spans a much wider range. This already gives us an early hint that Tesla might be more volatile compared to Apple and Microsoft.</p>

<p>Volatility is a frequently encountered concept in the world of finance and holds great importance for investors. <strong>But what exactly is volatility?</strong> Volatility refers to the degree of fluctuation in the price of a financial asset. In other words, it describes how quickly and significantly the price of an asset changes.</p>
<p>In order to analyze the risk of the stock we’ll need to take a closer look at the daily changes of the stock, and not just its absolute value. we calculate the daily return, which is just the change in price from one trading day to the next. It’s a simple but powerful way to track how a stock performs over time, spot volatility, and get a better sense of how efficient a portfolio really is.</p>

<p>To analyze a stock’s risk, we don’t just look at its price — we track how much the price changes each day. This is where daily return comes in: calculates the daily return of a stock by taking today’s price, dividing it by yesterday’s price, and subtracting 1. This shows the percentage change in the stock’s value from one day to the next.</p>

<p>One thing stands out here: Tesla (TSLA) is far more volatile than Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). While AAPL and MSFT tend to show steady, predictable price movements, TSLA swings much more aggressively from day to day. This kind of behavior points to Tesla being a more speculative and higher-risk stock.</p>

<p>To better understand how volatility changes over time, we grouped the daily returns into half-year periods and calculated the standard deviation for each. The chart below shows how the risk level evolved for each stock.</p>
<p>Markets tend to get turbulent during uncertain times — whether it’s due to political unrest, economic shifts, natural disasters, or unexpected company news. In such periods, stock prices can swing sharply, creating both big risks and big opportunities or losses.</p>
<p>The period from 2019 to 2024 was anything but ordinary. From the COVID-19 outbreak and the vaccine rollout, to the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, and the recent AI-driven stock surge — markets have been shaped by one major event after another.</p>
<p>To keep our analysis clear and accessible, we decided to use a simpler method — grouping adjusted daily returns into half-year periods and calculating the standard deviation for each group.</p>
<div style="background-color:#f1fdf5; border-left:4px solid #81c784; padding:10px 16px; margin: 20px 0; font-size:0.95em; color:#2e7d32;">
<p>In the code below, we group daily returns into half-year periods and calculate the average (mean) and risk (standard deviation) for each stock in each period.</p>

<p>The story told by the graph is pretty straightforward — and honestly, it played out just like we expected.</p>
<p>In early 2020, when COVID-19 hit, volatility shot up across the board. Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla all saw sharp spikes as markets were rattled by global uncertainty.</p>
<p>By early 2021, things started to settle. With vaccine rollouts underway and a clearer path forward, investor confidence slowly returned, and volatility dropped.</p>
<p>Then came early 2022. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered another wave of market turbulence. But just like before, the shock faded, and things gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>Up to that point, the three stocks were moving in sync — reacting to global events in similar ways and eventually finding their footing.</p>
<p>But 2023 broke that pattern.</p>
<p>That’s when the AI boom started gaining serious traction, and Tesla began to break away from the pack. While Apple and Microsoft stayed relatively stable, Tesla’s volatility picked up again — likely fueled by hype, speculation, and sector-specific buzz.</p>
<p>Sure, Tesla swings harder than the others. But that’s also part of what draws investors in. Bigger risk can mean bigger reward — and for some, that trade-off is worth it.</p>
<p>In the following section, we’ll take a closer look at how each stock actually performed.</p>

<p>There are two main ways: arithmetic mean and geometric mean. The arithmetic mean simply averages the returns — add them up, divide by the number of periods. It’s quick, easy, and great for short-term comparisons.</p>
<p>We’re using the arithmetic mean here because we’re focused on comparing average performance over set time intervals — not modeling long-term compounding.</p>

<p>In the previous section, we mentioned that risk can also lead to reward. So after seeing Tesla’s extreme volatility, you might be thinking:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Well, with all that risk, I hope the returns are worth it!”</em></strong></p>
<p>Let’s find out by grouping adjusted daily returns into half-year periods — using the same method we applied for volatility.</p>

<p>In the chart, the y-axis shows average daily returns, ranging from -0.4% to +0.6%. This scale helps us quickly see which stocks had positive or negative average performance in each period and how they compare to one another.</p>
</div>
<p>Chart Explanation: While Apple and Microsoft remained relatively stable, Tesla stood out — swinging between extreme highs and lows. It’s a textbook example of the risk-return tradeoff.</p>
<p>In early 2020, when the pandemic hit, Tesla surged. Both volatility and returns spiked — high risk, high reward.</p>
<p>But in early 2022, amid war and economic tension, Tesla was just as volatile — yet this time, returns turned negative. Same risk, opposite outcome.</p>
<p>By 2023, as markets rebounded, so did Tesla.</p>
<p>If you remember where volatility spiked in the earlier “Volatility Over Time” chart, we can compare it with the “Average Return” chart and make the following observation: Volatility can bring big gains or steep losses. It’s not just a signal of opportunity, but a warning, too.</p>
<p>This brings us to a critical question:</p>

<p>This comparison could also be done using summary statistics or a table of values, but a visual plot makes the trade-off between risk and return easier to interpret at a glance.</p>

<p>As seen in the chart, Tesla offers the highest expected return — but it also carries the highest risk. Microsoft stands out as the most stable option, with the lowest risk and a solid, moderate return. Apple lands somewhere in the middle on both fronts.</p>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Estimating Expected Annual Return Using Regression Analysis</h1>
<p>Regression analysis comes with several applications in finance. For example, the statistical method is fundamental to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).</p>
<section id="capital-asset-pricing-model-capm" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="capital-asset-pricing-model-capm"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</h2>
<p>The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between the expected return and risk of investing in a security. It shows that the expected return on a security is equal to the risk-free return plus a risk premium, which is based on the beta of that security. Below is an illustration of the CAPM concept.</p>

<p>In CAPM analysis, the S&amp;P 500 is commonly used as the “market portfolio” for comparing individual stocks like Apple (AAPL).</p>

<p>Apple’s excess returns tend to react quite strongly to market ups and downs, with a beta of 1.2—so when the market moves, Apple usually moves even more.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of positive alpha, meaning Apple might be doing a little better than what the market predicts, but it’s not statistically significant. In other words, we can’t say for sure that Apple consistently beats market expectations.</p>
<p>The model itself does a solid job, explaining about 61% of the day-to-day swings in Apple’s returns, which is actually quite good by finance standards.</p>
<p>We created the linear model below to visually show the relationship between Apple’s excess returns and the S&amp;P 500’s excess returns.</p>

<p>The red line you see is the regression line (sometimes called the CAPM fit). It shows what the model predicts about how Apple’s excess returns move in relation to the S&amp;P 500’s excess returns.</p>
<p>The steepness of this line—known as beta—tells us how much Apple’s returns typically respond when the market goes up or down. You can also find this beta value in the linear regression summary.</p>
<p>Each blue dot represents a real day of trading: it’s Apple’s actual excess return plotted against the S&amp;P 500’s excess return for that day. When you look at all the blue dots together, you can see how closely the real-world results match up with what the model predicts. If the dots stick close to the line, the model is doing a good job. If they’re scattered far away, there’s more going on than the model can explain.</p>
<p>For the next step, you take the beta value—that’s the slope of the red regression line—and use it in the CAPM formula along with the risk-free rate and the market risk premium. By plugging these numbers into the formula, you can calculate the expected return for Apple. In other words, CAPM helps you estimate how much return investors should expect, given Apple’s sensitivity to market movements and the extra reward for taking on market risk.</p>

<p>What is the expected annual return of Apple using the CAPM formula? In other words, according to the CAPM model, what is Apple’s projected return for this year?</p>
<p>Let’s break down the answer using the formula from above in the article:</p>
<p>Expected return = Risk Free Rate + [Beta x Market Return Premium]</p>
<ul>
<li>Market risk premium” is typically taken from financial reports, academic sources (like Damodaran), or calculated as the difference between average market returns (e.g., S&amp;P 500) and the current risk-free rate.</li>

<pre><code>Expected return (annual, %): 11.47 %</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to the CAPM model, Apple’s expected annual return is approximately 11–11.5%. This means that, given the current risk-free rate, market risk premium, and Apple’s beta, investors can expect an average annual return of around 11% if they hold Apple stock.</p>
<p><em>How about the risk ?</em> An 11% annual return isn’t risky on its own, but in finance, such high returns usually come with higher risk. It reflects compensation for bearing more uncertainty.</p>

</p><p>Diversification means spreading investments across different assets to reduce exposure to the risk of any single investment. The basic idea is that not all assets move in the same direction at the same time. By combining assets with different risk and return profiles, investors can potentially reduce the overall risk of their portfolio while maintaining reasonable return expectations. The goal of diversification is to reduce overall volatility and achieve a more balanced return by combining assets with low correlation.</p>

<p>Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) show a strong positive correlation (0.73), indicating their daily returns tend to move in the same direction. Tesla (TSLA) is less correlated with both AAPL (0.47) and MSFT (0.43), suggesting it behaves more independently in terms of daily returns.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-portfolio"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Proposed Portfolio</h2>
<p>The proposed portfolio allocation of 50% Microsoft, 30% Tesla, and 20% Apple is based on the observed correlation structure among the assets and the goal of achieving effective diversification.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Apple are highly correlated, which means they tend to move in the same direction. Allocating too much to both would reduce diversification benefits. Therefore, Microsoft is kept as the core low-volatility asset, while Apple’s weight is limited to avoid excessive overlap.</p>
<p>Tesla, on the other hand, has only moderate correlation with both Microsoft and Apple. Including Tesla at a moderate level (30%) enhances diversification and adds growth potential, without excessively increasing portfolio risk.</p>

<p>The Sharpe ratio is one of the most widely used methods for measuring risk-adjusted relative returns. It compares a fund’s historical or projected returns relative to an investment benchmark with the historical or expected variability of such returns.</p>
<p>The higher the ratio, the higher the risk compensation an investment offers. Investors will therefore have a preference for investments with a high Sharpe ratio or investments that raise the entire portfolio’s Sharpe ratio through diversification.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-portfolio-performs-best"><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Which Portfolio Performs Best?</h2>
<p>As expected, the proposed portfolio (50% MSFT – 30% TSLA – 20% AAPL) achieved the highest Sharpe ratio (1.32) among all compared strategies, confirming our hypothesis that this allocation provides the most efficient return relative to the risk taken.</p>
<p>The Evenly Split Portfolio, which distributes capital equally across all three assets without considering their risk characteristics, follows closely with a Sharpe ratio of 1.30, but falls slightly behind in efficiency.</p>
<p>All single-asset portfolios (100% in either Tesla, Apple, or Microsoft) perform worse in terms of risk-adjusted return:</p>
<p>Tesla shows the lowest Sharpe ratio (0.97) due to its high volatility and drawdown,</p>
<p>Apple (1.10) and Microsoft (1.16) perform better individually but lack the benefits of diversification.</p>
<p>These results confirm that strategic asset allocation, rather than equal weighting or concentration in a single asset, leads to better risk-adjusted performance.</p>

<section id="recommendation" class="level2" data-number="5.6">
<h2 data-number="5.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommendation"><span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Recommendation</h2>
<p>While the proposed portfolio (50% Microsoft, 30% Tesla, 20% Apple) achieved the highest Sharpe ratio in our analysis, it is important to emphasize that there is no universally ideal portfolio. The optimal allocation depends not only on numerical performance metrics but also on the investor’s individual risk tolerance, goals, and personal preferences.</p>
<p>For example, an investor with a high risk appetite may reasonably prefer a higher allocation to Tesla, accepting greater volatility in exchange for potentially higher returns. In contrast, a more conservative investor might prioritize stability and allocate more heavily to Microsoft or Apple.</p>
<p>Therefore, we recommend that portfolio construction should not be based solely on statistical indicators such as the Sharpe ratio. Instead, investors should take into account their own investment personality, time horizon, and financial goals. Quantitative results can inform decision-making—but they should be used as a guide, not as a rule.</p>

<span id="cb45-400"><a href="#cb45-400" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-401"><a href="#cb45-401" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In early 2020, when COVID-19 hit, volatility shot up across the board. Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla all saw sharp spikes as markets were rattled by global uncertainty.</span>
<span id="cb45-402"><a href="#cb45-402" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-403"><a href="#cb45-403" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>By early 2021, things started to settle. With vaccine rollouts underway and a clearer path forward, investor confidence slowly returned, and volatility dropped.</span>
<span id="cb45-404"><a href="#cb45-404" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-405"><a href="#cb45-405" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Then came early 2022. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered another wave of market turbulence. But just like before, the shock faded, and things gradually stabilized.</span>
<span id="cb45-406"><a href="#cb45-406" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-407"><a href="#cb45-407" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Up to that point, the three stocks were moving in sync — reacting to global events in similar ways and eventually finding their footing.</span>

<span id="cb45-411"><a href="#cb45-411" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>That’s when the AI boom started gaining serious traction, and Tesla began to break away from the pack. While Apple and Microsoft stayed relatively stable, Tesla’s volatility picked up again — likely fueled by hype, speculation, and sector-specific buzz.</span>
<span id="cb45-412"><a href="#cb45-412" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-413"><a href="#cb45-413" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Sure, Tesla swings harder than the others. But that’s also part of what draws investors in. Bigger risk can mean bigger reward — and for some, that trade-off is worth it.</span>

<span id="cb45-423"><a href="#cb45-423" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>There are two main ways: arithmetic mean and geometric mean.</span>
<span id="cb45-424"><a href="#cb45-424" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The arithmetic mean simply averages the returns — add them up, divide by the number of periods. It’s quick, easy, and great for short-term comparisons.</span>
<span id="cb45-425"><a href="#cb45-425" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-426"><a href="#cb45-426" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>We’re using the arithmetic mean here because we’re focused on comparing average performance over set time intervals — not modeling long-term compounding.</span>

<span id="cb45-487"><a href="#cb45-487" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While Apple and Microsoft remained relatively stable, Tesla stood out — swinging between extreme highs and lows. It’s a textbook example of the risk-return tradeoff.</span>
<span id="cb45-488"><a href="#cb45-488" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-489"><a href="#cb45-489" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In early 2020, when the pandemic hit, Tesla surged. Both volatility and returns spiked — high risk, high reward.</span>
<span id="cb45-490"><a href="#cb45-490" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-491"><a href="#cb45-491" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>But in early 2022, amid war and economic tension, Tesla was just as volatile — yet this time, returns turned negative. Same risk, opposite outcome.</span>
<span id="cb45-492"><a href="#cb45-492" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-493"><a href="#cb45-493" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>By 2023, as markets rebounded, so did Tesla.</span>

<span id="cb45-495"><a href="#cb45-495" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>If you remember where volatility spiked in the earlier "Volatility Over Time" chart, we can compare it with the "Average Return" chart and make the following observation: Volatility can bring big gains or steep losses. It’s not just a signal of opportunity, but a warning, too.</span>

When you look at all the blue dots together, you can see how closely the real-world results match up with what the model predicts. If the dots stick close to the line, the model is doing a good job. If they’re scattered far away, there’s more going on than the model can explain.</span>

By plugging these numbers into the formula, you can calculate the expected return for Apple. In other words, CAPM helps you estimate how much return investors should expect, given Apple’s sensitivity to market movements and the extra reward for taking on market risk.</span>

<span id="cb45-912"><a href="#cb45-912" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-913"><a href="#cb45-913" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Apple (1.10) and Microsoft (1.16) perform better individually but lack the benefits of diversification.</span>

<span id="cb45-915"><a href="#cb45-915" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>These results confirm that strategic asset allocation, rather than equal weighting or concentration in a single asset, leads to better risk-adjusted performance.</span>

<span id="cb45-918"><a href="#cb45-918" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-919"><a href="#cb45-919" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>While the proposed portfolio (50% Microsoft, 30% Tesla, 20% Apple) achieved the highest Sharpe ratio in our analysis, it is important to emphasize that there is no universally ideal portfolio.</span>
<span id="cb45-920"><a href="#cb45-920" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The optimal allocation depends not only on numerical performance metrics but also on the investor's individual risk tolerance, goals, and personal preferences.</span>
<span id="cb45-921"><a href="#cb45-921" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-922"><a href="#cb45-922" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>For example, an investor with a high risk appetite may reasonably prefer a higher allocation to Tesla, accepting greater volatility in exchange for potentially higher returns.</span>
<span id="cb45-923"><a href="#cb45-923" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In contrast, a more conservative investor might prioritize stability and allocate more heavily to Microsoft or Apple.</span>
<span id="cb45-924"><a href="#cb45-924" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb45-925"><a href="#cb45-925" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Therefore, we recommend that portfolio construction should not be based solely on statistical indicators such as the Sharpe ratio.</span>
<span id="cb45-926"><a href="#cb45-926" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Instead, investors should take into account their own investment personality, time horizon, and financial goals.</span>
<span id="cb45-927"><a href="#cb45-927" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Quantitative results can inform decision-making—but they should be used as a guide, not as a rule.</span>
