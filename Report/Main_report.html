<p>Below is a summary of the questions explored in this report and the analytical approaches used to address them:</p>
<ul style="line-height:1.8; font-size:1.05em;">
<li>
<strong>How has the stock price changed over time?</strong><br> Analyzed using a line chart with Plotly.
</li>
<li>
<strong>How do we calculate volatility?</strong><br> Calculated as the standard deviation of daily returns.
</li>
<li>
<strong>What is the average daily return of the stock?</strong><br> Computed using the arithmetic mean of daily returns.
</li>
<li>
<strong>How much value is at risk when investing in a stock?</strong><br> Visualized using a scatter plot of mean return versus standard deviation (risk-return profile).
</li>
<li>
<strong>How do you calculate the expected annual return for an asset?</strong><br> Estimated using the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) via linear regression on excess returns.
</li>
<li>
<strong>What is the correlation between different stocks?</strong><br> Assessed using a Pearson correlation matrix with visualization via <code>corrplot</code>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>How can we build a diversified stock portfolio?</strong><br> Based on diversification logic derived from correlation differences between assets.
</li>
</ul>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> How has the stock price changed over time?</h1>
<p>One of the first questions in the mind of any new investor in the stock market is that why do stock prices change every second?</p>
<p>Well, there’s no straightforward answer to that question. The price of a stock is influenced by many different forces—each affecting its direction and magnitude. While it’s possible to understand some of these factors, trying to predict the market often proves to be more misleading than helpful.</p>
<p>Instead of predicting, a more effective approach is to observe how prices have moved in the past.</p>

<p>We use adjusted closing prices because they account for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions, giving a more accurate view of the stock’s true return over time.</p>

<p>Volatility is a frequently encountered concept in the world of finance and holds great importance for investors. <em>But what exactly is volatility?</em> Volatility refers to the degree of fluctuation in the price of a financial asset. In other words, it describes how quickly and significantly the price of an asset changes.</p>
<p>When I was a kid I had an opportunity to have lunch with an economist from my country. One of the thing he said :“Volatility is uncertainty”. After so many years I consider it still the best one-word explanation.</p>
<p>To analyze a stock’s risk, we don’t just look at its price — we track how much the price changes each day. This is where daily return comes in: calculates the daily return of a stock by taking today’s Opening price, dividing it by yesterday’s Opening price, and subtracting 1. This shows the percentage change in the stock’s value from one day to the next.</p>

<p>In the code below, we use the <code>dailyReturn()</code> function from the <code>quantmod</code> package.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the adjusted prices were previously retrieved, we extract them again here because the dailyReturn() function requires the input to have a standard column name format.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The returns_list object contains time series data in xts format. This is because functions like dailyReturn() from packages such as quantmod and PerformanceAnalytics are specifically designed to work with financial time series, and therefore use the xts (eXtensible Time Series) class as their standard data structure.</p>

<p>The chart uses Plotly for interactive features like zooming and hovering. While ggplot2 could also be used, Plotly was preferred to better explore values on specific dates.</p>

<p>One thing stands out here: Tesla (TSLA) is far more volatile than Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). While AAPL and MSFT tend to show steady, predictable price movements, TSLA swings much more aggressively from day to day. This kind of behavior points to Tesla being a more speculative and higher-risk stock.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can observe periods when all three stocks move in the same direction — either rising or falling together. This suggests that broader market forces, such as economic news or global events, can affect all stocks simultaneously, regardless of their individual characteristics.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visualization-volatility-over-time"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Visualization: Volatility Over Time</h2>
<p>To better understand how volatility changes over time, we grouped the daily returns into half-year periods and calculated the standard deviation for each. The chart below shows how the risk level evolved for each stock.</p>
<p>Markets tend to get turbulent during uncertain times — whether it’s due to political unrest, economic shifts, natural disasters, or unexpected company news. In such periods, stock prices can swing sharply, creating both big risks and big opportunities or losses.</p>
<p>The period from 2019 to 2024 was anything but ordinary. From the COVID-19 outbreak to the war in Ukraine, rising inflation, and the recent AI-driven stock surge — markets have been shaped by one major event after another.</p>
<p>To keep our analysis clear, we decided to use a simpler method: - grouping adjusted daily returns into half-year periods and calculating the standard deviation for each group.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This method is not a standard approach in finance and was designed specifically for our analysis. While it helps simplify trends by grouping daily returns into half-year periods, it may also hide short-term changes. The choice of time intervals can influence the results.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As an alternative, the data could have been divided into smaller time intervals, or a GARCH model could have been used to estimate time-varying volatility more accurately. However, our goal was to keep the analysis simple and easy to understand. Additionally, we are not yet familiar with the GARCH model, so we decided to use a more straightforward method.</p>

<p>The story told by the graph is pretty straightforward — and honestly, it played out just like we expected.</p>
<p>In early 2020, when COVID-19 hit, volatility shot up across the board. Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla all saw sharp spikes as markets were rattled by global uncertainty.</p>
<p>By early 2021, things started to settle. With vaccine rollouts underway and a clearer path forward, investor confidence slowly returned, and volatility dropped.</p>
<p>Then came early 2022. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered another wave of market turbulence. But just like before, the shock faded, and things gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>Up to that point, the three stocks were moving in sync — reacting to global events in similar ways and eventually finding their footing.</p>
<p>Sure, Tesla swings harder than the others. But that’s also part of what draws investors in. Bigger risk can mean bigger reward — and for some, that trade-off is worth it.</p>
<p>In the following section, we’ll take a closer look at how each stock actually performed.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="average-daily-return-of-the-stock" class="level1" data-number="4">
<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Average daily return of the stock</h1>
<section id="arithmetic-mean-return-and-geometric-mean-return" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arithmetic-mean-return-and-geometric-mean-return"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Arithmetic Mean Return and Geometric Mean Return</h2>
<p>Before we jump into the results, a quick note on how returns are measured.</p>
<p>There are two main ways: arithmetic mean and geometric mean. The arithmetic mean simply averages the returns — add them up, divide by the number of periods. It’s quick, easy, and great for short-term comparisons.</p>
<p>We’re using the arithmetic mean here because we’re focused on comparing average performance over set time intervals — not modeling long-term compounding.</p>
</section>
<section id="visualization-average-returns-over-time" class="level2" data-number="4.2">
<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visualization-average-returns-over-time"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Visualization: Average Returns Over Time</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we mentioned that risk can also lead to reward. So after seeing Tesla’s extreme volatility, you might be thinking:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Well, with all that risk, I hope the returns are worth it!”</em></strong></p>
<p>Let’s find out by grouping adjusted daily returns into half-year periods — using the same method we applied for volatility.</p>

<p>In the code below, we create a chart that shows how returns changed over time and highlights the impact of key events.</p>

<p>In the chart, the y-axis shows average daily returns, ranging from -0.4% to +1%. This scale helps us quickly see which stocks had positive or negative average performance in each period and how they compare to one another.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although a 1% return may seem small, it is actually a very high rate in financial markets.</p>
<p>Chart Explanation: While Apple and Microsoft remained relatively stable, Tesla stood out — swinging between extreme highs and lows. It’s a textbook example of the risk-return tradeoff.</p>
<p>If you remember where volatility spiked in the earlier “Volatility Over Time” chart, we can compare it with the “Average Return” chart and make the following observation: Volatility can bring big gains or steep losses. It’s not just a signal of opportunity, but a warning, too.</p>
<p>This brings us to a critical question:</p>

<p>In the code below, we create a chart that compares expected daily return (x-axis) and risk (y-axis), making it easy to assess the risk-return profile of each stock.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color:#fce4ec; border-left:4px solid #f06292; padding:10px 16px; margin: 20px 0; font-size:0.95em; color:#880e4f;">
<p>This comparison would typically involve a risk curve. However, since we are comparing the stocks based on risk, using a risk versus expected daily return graph is actually a common and appropriate method.</p>

<p>This function offers a simple way to calculate the average daily return and risk (standard deviation) for multiple stocks at once. It also reshapes the data nicely, making it easy to compare. While this method works well for exploring basic risk-return patterns, it only looks at daily data and doesn’t convert the results to an annual scale, which can make comparisons harder. Technically, we could have done this by multiplying the daily mean by 252 and the standard deviation by the square root of 252 but for annual analysis, we will apply a different method in the next section.</p>
</div>
<p>As seen in the chart, Tesla offers the highest expected return — but it also carries the highest risk. Microsoft stands out as the most stable option, with the lowest risk and a solid, moderate return. Apple lands somewhere in the middle on both fronts.</p>

<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Estimating Expected Annual Returns</h1>
<p>Regression analysis comes with several applications in finance. For example, the statistical method is fundamental to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).</p>
<section id="capital-asset-pricing-model-capm" class="level2" data-number="5.1">
<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="capital-asset-pricing-model-capm"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</h2>
<p>The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model that describes the relationship between the expected return and risk of investing in a security. It shows that the expected return on a security is equal to the risk-free return plus a risk premium, which is based on the beta of that security. Below is an illustration of the CAPM concept.</p>
<p><img src="images/CAMP.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regression is used in CAPM because the model itself is linear, and regression offers both a way to estimate beta and to evaluate the model’s reliability. While direct covariance-based formulas can be used, they don’t provide diagnostic insights like regression does.</p>
<p>^GSPC is the symbol used by Yahoo Finance to represent the S&amp;P 500 index, which tracks the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.</p>
<p>In CAPM analysis, the S&amp;P 500 is commonly used as the “market portfolio” for comparing individual stocks like Apple (AAPL).</p>
<div style="background-color:#fce4ec; border-left:4px solid #f06292; padding:10px 16px; margin: 20px 0; font-size:0.95em; color:#880e4f;">
<p>The CAPM-based analysis transforms daily returns into annualized figures, enabling comparability across assets. It effectively captures the extent to which a stock moves with the overall market by estimating beta through linear regression. However, the method assumes a purely linear relationship and relies on a single-factor model. As a result, it overlooks idiosyncratic risk and excludes multi-factor influences that may impact returns in more complex market environments.</p>

<p>In the code below, we calculate log returns because they measure the relative daily price change. Log returns are preferred in finance since they are additive over time and better handle volatility. Returns (rather than prices) are used for regression and risk analysis.</p>

<p>Apple’s excess returns tend to react quite strongly to market ups and downs, with a beta of 1.2—so when the market moves, Apple usually moves even more.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of positive alpha, meaning Apple might be doing a little better than what the market predicts, but it’s not statistically significant. In other words, we can’t say for sure that Apple consistently beats market expectations.</p>
<p>The model itself does a solid job, explaining about 61% of the day-to-day swings in Apple’s returns, which is actually quite good by finance standards.</p>
<p>We created the linear model below to visually show the relationship between Apple’s excess returns and the S&amp;P 500’s excess returns.</p>

<p>The red line you see is the regression line (sometimes called the CAPM fit). It shows what the model predicts about how Apple’s excess returns move in relation to the S&amp;P 500’s excess returns.</p>
<p>The slope of this line—known as beta—tells us how much Apple’s returns typically respond when the market goes up or down. You can also find this beta value in the linear regression summary.</p>
<p>Each blue dot represents a real day of trading: it’s Apple’s actual excess return plotted against the S&amp;P 500’s excess return for that day. When you look at all the blue dots together, you can see how closely the real-world results match up with what the model predicts. If the dots stick close to the line, the model is doing a good job. If they’re scattered far away, there’s more going on than the model can explain.</p>
<p>For the next step, you take the beta value and use it in the CAPM formula along with the risk-free rate and the market risk premium. By plugging these numbers into the formula, you can calculate the expected return for Apple. In other words, CAPM helps you estimate how much return investors should expect, given Apple’s sensitivity to market movements and the extra reward for taking on market risk.</p>

<p>What is the expected annual return of Apple using the CAPM formula? In other words, according to the CAPM model, what is Apple’s projected return for this year?</p>
<p>Let’s find the answer using the formula from above in the article:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Market risk premium and annual risk-free rate is typically taken from financial reports.</p>

<p>According to the CAPM model, Apple’s expected annual return is approximately 10%. This means that, given the current risk-free rate, market risk premium, and Apple’s beta, investors can expect an average annual return of around 10% if they hold Apple stock.</p>
<p><strong>How about the risk ?</strong> An 10% annual return isn’t risky on its own, but in finance, high returns usually come with higher risk.</p>

<p>Microsoft (MSFT): Expected annual return = 10% - Indicates moderate risk and stable return, like APPL.</p>
<p>Tesla (TSLA): Expected annual return = 12% - Suggests higher risk and higher expected return, reflecting stronger sensitivity to market changes.</p>
<p>In short: Tesla offers greater return potential but comes with higher risk, while Microsoft and Apple provide more stable performance with lower volatility.</p>

</p><p>Diversification means investing in different assets to reduce the risk of relying on any single one. Since not all assets move together, combining those with different risk and return profiles—especially ones with low correlation—can help smooth out portfolio performance. When one asset drops, another might hold steady or rise, reducing overall volatility and supporting more stable returns.</p>

<p>Before diversifying a portfolio, correlation analysis helps find assets that don’t move in the same way. This makes it easier to reduce risk by choosing different types of investments. However, correlation can be affected by unusual data points (outliers) and may change over time. For example, during a financial crisis, many assets become more closely linked, which can reduce the benefit of diversification.</p>

<p>Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) show a strong positive correlation (0.73), indicating their daily returns tend to move in the same direction. Tesla (TSLA) is less correlated with both AAPL (0.47) and MSFT (0.43), suggesting it behaves more independently in terms of daily returns.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="proposed-portfolio"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Proposed Portfolio</h2>
<p>The proposed portfolio allocation of 50% Microsoft, 30% Tesla, and 20% Apple is based on the observed correlation structure among the assets and the goal of achieving effective diversification.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While a 50-25-25 split was possible, Tesla’s high volatility would raise overall risk. Microsoft was given more weight to stabilize the portfolio.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Apple are highly correlated, which means they tend to move in the same direction. Allocating too much to both would reduce diversification benefits. Therefore, Microsoft is kept as the core low-volatility asset, while Apple’s weight is limited to avoid excessive overlap.</p>
<p>Tesla, on the other hand, has only moderate correlation with both Microsoft and Apple. Including Tesla at a moderate level (30%) enhances diversification and adds growth potential, without excessively increasing portfolio risk.</p>

<p>The Sharpe ratio is one of the most widely used methods for measuring risk-adjusted relative returns. It compares a fund’s historical or projected returns relative to an investment benchmark with the historical or expected variability of such returns.</p>
<p>The higher the ratio, the higher the risk compensation an investment offers. Investors will therefore have a preference for investments with a high Sharpe ratio or investments that raise the entire portfolio’s Sharpe ratio through diversification.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Sharpe ratio measures how much return a portfolio generates per unit of risk and is commonly used for performance comparisons. It considers all types of volatility. As alternatives, the Sortino ratio focuses only on downside risk, while the Treynor ratio accounts for market risk.</p>

<p>Although the proposed portfolio (MSFT 50% – TSLA 30% – AAPL 20%) and the equally weighted portfolio (33.3% each) yielded similar results, this proximity may be considered coincidental.</p>
<p>What truly matters is that the proposed allocation outperforms all single-asset portfolios by a clear margin.</p>
<p>Therefore, allocating assets in a balanced and informed manner is essential for maximizing risk-adjusted returns—confirming the validity of our hypothesis.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recommendation"><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> Recommendation</h2>
<p>Portfolio diversification should not be based solely on numerical performance indicators; optimal allocation must also consider the investor’s risk tolerance, financial goals, and personal preferences.</p>
<p>For example, an investor with a high risk appetite may reasonably prefer a higher allocation to Tesla, accepting greater volatility in exchange for potentially higher returns. In contrast, a more conservative investor might prioritize stability and allocate more heavily to Microsoft or Apple.</p>
<p>Quantitative results can inform decision-making—but they should be used as a guide, not as a rule.</p>

<span id="cb49-119"><a href="#cb49-119" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Well, there’s no straightforward answer to that question. The price of a stock is influenced by many different forces—each affecting its direction and magnitude.

This shows the percentage change in the stock's value from one day to the next.</span>

<span id="cb49-264"><a href="#cb49-264" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>One thing stands out here: Tesla (TSLA) is far more volatile than Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). While AAPL and MSFT tend to show steady, predictable price movements, TSLA swings much more aggressively from day to day. This kind of behavior points to Tesla being a more speculative and higher-risk stock.</span>

<span id="cb49-266"><a href="#cb49-266" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>At the same time, we can observe periods when all three stocks move in the same direction — either rising or falling together. This suggests that broader market forces, such as economic news or global events, can affect all stocks simultaneously, regardless of their individual characteristics.</span>

<span id="cb49-270"><a href="#cb49-270" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>To better understand how volatility changes over time, we grouped the daily returns into half-year periods and calculated the standard deviation for each. The chart below shows how the risk level evolved for each stock.</span>

<span id="cb49-272"><a href="#cb49-272" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Markets tend to get turbulent during uncertain times — whether it’s due to political unrest, economic shifts, natural disasters, or unexpected company news. In such periods, stock prices can swing sharply, creating both big risks and big opportunities or losses.</span>

<span id="cb49-274"><a href="#cb49-274" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The period from 2019 to 2024 was anything but ordinary.

<span id="cb49-276"><a href="#cb49-276" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>To keep our analysis clear, we decided to use a simpler method: - grouping adjusted daily returns into half-year periods and calculating the standard deviation for each group.</span>

<span id="cb49-278"><a href="#cb49-278" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Note:** This method is not a standard approach in finance and was designed specifically for our analysis. While it helps simplify trends by grouping daily returns into half-year periods, it may also hide short-term changes. The choice of time intervals can influence the results.</span>
<span id="cb49-279"><a href="#cb49-279" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb49-280"><a href="#cb49-280" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>**Note:** As an alternative, the data could have been divided into smaller time intervals, or a GARCH model could have been used to estimate time-varying volatility more accurately. However, our goal was to keep the analysis simple and easy to understand. Additionally, we are not yet familiar with the GARCH model, so we decided to use a more straightforward method.</span>

It effectively captures the extent to which a stock moves with the overall market by estimating beta through linear regression. However, the method assumes a purely linear relationship and relies on a single-factor model. As a result, it overlooks idiosyncratic risk and excludes multi-factor influences that may impact returns in more complex market environments.</span>

If they’re scattered far away, there’s more going on than the model can explain.</span>

In other words, CAPM helps you estimate how much return investors should expect, given Apple’s sensitivity to market movements and the extra reward for taking on market risk.</span>

<span id="cb49-727"><a href="#cb49-727" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Diversification means investing in different assets to reduce the risk of relying on any single one. Since not all assets move together, combining those with different risk and return profiles—especially ones with low correlation—can help smooth out portfolio performance. When one asset drops, another might hold steady or rise, reducing overall volatility and supporting more stable returns.</span>

<span id="cb49-730"><a href="#cb49-730" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Before diversifying a portfolio, correlation analysis helps find assets that don’t move in the same way. This makes it easier to reduce risk by choosing different types of investments. However, correlation can be affected by unusual data points (outliers) and may change over time. For example, during a financial crisis, many assets become more closely linked, which can reduce the benefit of diversification.</span>

<span id="cb49-834"><a href="#cb49-834" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The higher Sharpe ratios observed in strategically allocated portfolios indicate that returns can be enhanced while managing risk more effectively.</span>
<span id="cb49-835"><a href="#cb49-835" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb49-836"><a href="#cb49-836" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Although the proposed portfolio (MSFT 50% – TSLA 30% – AAPL 20%) and the equally weighted portfolio (33.3% each) yielded similar results, this proximity may be considered coincidental.</span>
<span id="cb49-837"><a href="#cb49-837" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb49-838"><a href="#cb49-838" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>What truly matters is that the proposed allocation outperforms all single-asset portfolios by a clear margin.</span>

<span id="cb49-840"><a href="#cb49-840" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Therefore, allocating assets in a balanced and informed manner is essential for maximizing risk-adjusted returns—confirming the validity of our hypothesis.</span>

<span id="cb49-843"><a href="#cb49-843" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb49-844"><a href="#cb49-844" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Portfolio diversification should not be based solely on numerical performance indicators; optimal allocation must also consider the investor’s risk tolerance, financial goals, and personal preferences.</span>
<span id="cb49-845"><a href="#cb49-845" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb49-846"><a href="#cb49-846" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>For example, an investor with a high risk appetite may reasonably prefer a higher allocation to Tesla, accepting greater volatility in exchange for potentially higher returns. In contrast, a more conservative investor might prioritize stability and allocate more heavily to Microsoft or Apple.</span>

<span id="cb49-848"><a href="#cb49-848" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Quantitative results can inform decision-making—but they should be used as a guide, not as a rule.</span>
